#The perfect browser

##I wrote this post after getting inspired by [this article on Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/fuck-it-im-going-back-to-firefox-1685425815)

These days net users have tought life. We need at least i-series processor, couple gigabytes of ram and pretty fast DSL (or LTE) connection to just **BROWSE THE WEB**.

Yes, I've name it - to just surf around the regular internet user has to acquire hardware that exceeds couple times the one that has sent human to the moon - I think we've gone somewhere terribly wrong.

Of course that nowadays we have rich web applications, full of advanced animations and splendid transitions with real-time features in addition. And of course these benefits requires some additional computing resources but (as a developers) we should aim to create maximally optimised app code.

(a similiar trend is visible in gaming - when I see a 2D simple platform game that needs at least i7 quad-core 3GHz+, 8GB of RAM etc. then I feel that some part of gamemakers became incredible lazy when it goes about engine optimization)

##As a developers we should aim to create maximally optimised app code

I'm a huge fan of simplification & minimalism. My perfect browser should first of all enable browsing web fast, safely & intuitively.  There's no need to reinwent the wheel - current solutions provides such goals - unfortunately most of them are possible thanks to 3rd party browser plugins. 

##My perfect browser idea gets rid of plugins and has all these features out of the box. 

So, what's actually included in my perfect browser must-have main features?

#webkit based

#smart bookmarks

#better preventing from popup window/tab auto opening

#memory management

#built-in email notifications

#no start page (blank page)

#cloud synchronization (passwords, bookmarks)

#devtools initialization only when needed (if not, then don't even think about taking memory for it)
