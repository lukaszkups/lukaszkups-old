#Things to do after installing ElementaryOS

##Couple days ago I was upgrading  my system (from ElementaryOS beta to stable version). Unfortunately it is related  with system reinstallation.

For those who do not know this linux distribution I'll refer to check [this link](http://elementaryos.org). In short, it is the most polished and beautiful linux distro ever made.

Some people accuse that elementary developers are copying apple's OSX design guidelines. Personally, as a past OSX user I think it is not copying, but inspiration is definitely visible.
