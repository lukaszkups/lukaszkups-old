#If You like Pina Coladas (a.k.a. Should You REALLY work for free?)

Couple days ago I've found on [hackernews](http://news.ycombinator.com) a guide for working for free. There was a couple of paths to follow and decide if we should work for free or not. 

Personally I'm really against working for free (as long as client is not Your mother of father) and I decided to make a simpler version of that site: [shoudIreallyworkforfree.com](http://shouldireallyworkforfree.com).

Enjoy and feel free to share this site to every client that wants You to work for them for free.
