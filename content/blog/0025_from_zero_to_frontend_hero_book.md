#From zero to Front-end hero book

Some time ago I was doing some internal workshops for my colegues about front-end basics. 

The 2-hour long interactive presentation covered the fundamental topics about practical use of javascript and jQuery.

Some time later I've found that some of the atendees works now with javascript pretty well and the other not so good. I decided to make a quick face-to-face survey with those who doesn't really understand everything at the presentation (most of them were afraid to simply ask a question during the workshops). 

The information that I've collected enabled me to understand the problem with learning modern front-end development. 

So I decided to write an (e-)book about it.

The draft of the book is currently in (around) halfway there - it covers the topics about HTML & CSS elements, with practical use-cases and hacks. There's still a huge amount of work to do, but I think it will be ready in the beginnings of upcoming year 2016.

If You want to stay updated about the book, feel free to subscribe to my (book-only) mailing list.

I won't spam You never-ever. Promise.
