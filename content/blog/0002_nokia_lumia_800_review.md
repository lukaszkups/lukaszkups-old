#Nokia Lumia 800 review

![lumia](/blog/images/lumia_01.jpg)

I don't really like many Microsoft products (yeah, that's a nice kind of intro), but their Windows Phone 7+ system is one their greatest achievements - in design and software field.

Most of my early smartphones was based on Android OS. That system drove me mad when after couple days of using my ~1000PLN device started to randomly hang or slow down. 

Then Microsoft and Nokia announced and started to sell Lumia devices with Windows Phone 7 OS. Despite the reluctance to products from Microsoft company I was fascinated about *Metro* design (later renamed but adopted by nobody to *Modern UI* ). 

After first reviews about WP7, I started thinking about switching to it. Despite lack of customization options and very, very small amount of apps in its market I've finally bought my first WP7 phone - *Nokia Lumia 800*.

##It has been three years since I've bought Lumia 800. And it is so far the longest used phone by me. 

In the meantime I've bought *HTC 8X* with new, Windows Phone 8.1 OS. I've sold that device after couple of days because of very short battery life. I also had a pleasure using *Lumia 920* as my second phone for some time, and I'm totally sure that my next phone will be WP8-based (currently looking for white *Lumia 1020* ).
