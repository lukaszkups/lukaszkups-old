#Best investments in 2015

This article should be really named 'Best investments till 2015 end'. Because it is the first this type in the serie, I'll introduce my favourite investments in tool/gadgets/all kind of stuff I've done so far. I plan to repeat this type of article every year to sum and share thoughts on stuff that is worth to spend money for.

##Opel Vectra 1.9 CDTI 2008'

I'm a proud owner of the latest model of Opel's Vectra model. I own the sedan version, which is pretty comfortable for 1+1 family model, but it lacks of space a bit when it comes to travel with little kid and his accessories.
 
The most awesome thing about this car is its suspension. Opel did awesome job here and installed very soft and flexible shocks. You can compare driving Vectra C to boating in the lake, during summer afternoon.

The engine is 101 horse powered diesel which is really mediocre amount for such heavy unit (~1000kg). Fortunately I've managed to solve this issue thanks to..

##PowerBox Tuning Kit

This is a really simple device that enables You to modify the on-board car computer settings (most of them are based on pump injectors etc.). Equipment installation consists of connecting this device to common rail under Your car's hood (that means it's exclusive to diesel-powered cars).

You can read many bad things about this tool, but personally I'm very satisfied of its work. The new unit can cost You ~$300, I've bought mine from relative who used it for almost 3 years for half price. 

I had some real doubts about this device at first (mostly because I was not sure how it can affect health of the engine) but after 2+ years of driving with this tool I can't say any bad word about it. I think the key is to setup this device properly (by not maximizing every option to the limit :) ) and to change gears at ~3000RPMs max etc. The funny part is that You can disconnect it whenever You want (just unplug it from common rail).

In my example, I've set every parameter up to 16 points (where 20 is max) and I've noticed huge injection of power (around +25hp) with slight reduction of fuel consumption (now around 7l/100km, was more than 8l/100km).

##Asus Zenbook UX32LN

Last year I've switched from 2012 Macbook to Asus's linux-powered device. 

I've made a switch because I've wanted something more mobile and was I was really tired of OSX operating system, which from version to version is getting worse (IMHO).

The specs of the Zenbook are very similiar to previous Macbook's: 1.8/3.0 Intel Core i7 4500U, 12GB of DDR3 RAM memory, 128GB SSD disk, NVIDIA GeForce GT 840M (2GB GDDR3) + Intel HD Graphics 4400, 13" FullHD matte display, multitouch trackpad and backlit keyboard. 

I haven't bought the newest model, because I haven't seen any other incetivies to pay 1/4 price more than touch display (which has no sense for my daily use).

In the beginning I've got some problems with wifi chipset drivers, but after some struggle I've installed finally Elementary OS linux distribution (at this moment this issue is deprecated, because device drivers list is updated).

I have to admit, that Asus is making great job with Zenbook product line. It is stylish. It just works, goddamit! :)

The only pain for me is the real battery life, which is around 3 hours with no-compromises work (programming + video) but since I work on it as like PC most of the time(connected external monitor, keyboard and mouse) I have it plugged to power source almost constantly.

The price for this Zenbook model currently oscillates within $1000(new) or less(used).

##Nokia Lumia 735

I've bought it last year, during current one my wife bought it too. This is the best windows phone 8 device on the market if You're care about really good quality for attractive price (new device costs around $190). You can read more about this smartphone [here](http://lukaszkups.net/blog/0023_nokia_lumia_735_review/).

##NORDMÄRKE

A wireless Qi charger from IKEA. My choose was plastic + wooden version of circle shaped, single charge model. It looks very minimalistic and neat on white table desk. I've bought it for my Lumia device, which I use for exclusively (my wife bought a leather skin for her model and lost a Qi charging feature at the same moment because of it). A good move from IKEA was to include additional USB port inside this gadget so You can charge multiple devices at the same time. Currently, You can get this charger for around $40 at every IKEA store. 

##Painting reflectors

Again car-related investment. For some time I've been struggling with my car poor lighting. I thought that it may be an placebo effect, because I had to remove the Xenon bulbs installed by previous car owner, which were illegal (additional pricey equipment was needed to keep them). Finally I took my car to repair shop and it turned out that the reflectors are burned and dull (it was caused partly because of the previous Xenon installation and because of the end of their lifespan). 

I had 2 solutions from there: bought brand new reflectors (~ $500 for a pair) or regenerate current ones ($125 per unit) - guess which one I've chosen? 

I'm totally satisfied with the effect - now my passing lights iluminate the road as far as my country beam ones did before the regeneration!

##Discover Meteor and couple other books

If You actually didn't know, I'm a big fan of the [MeteorJS](http://meteor.com) framework. Most of baby steps knowledge I've found in [Discover Meteor](http://discovermeteor.com) book. [Sacha Greif](http://twitter.com/SachaGreif) and [Tom Coleman](http://twitter.com/tmeasday) are doing awesome job, constantly updating their book contents up to current MeteorJS version. I recommend this book to every developer who wants to learn Meteor.

The other books worth mentioning are written by [Jason Hunt](http://jasonhunt.pl) (previously known as Kominek - one of the most popular Polish bloggers) and they are:

-- "Bloger i Social Media" and "Bloger" - books about the art of blogging, building own brand, community, dealing with sponsors and how to organize awesome marketing campaigns. Those books are also published in English, but under single title: "The Influencer". I recommend those positions for everyone who is thinking about *going online* but don't know how to start - for everyone else it is a great collection of advices and tips, listed in one place.

Other books that I recommend:

-- "Metro 2033: Otchłań" (Abyss) by Robert J. Szmidt

-- "Metro 2033: Mrówańcza" (Murancha)  by Ruslan Melnikov

-- Any other Metro 2033 Universe book

As I've written above, I just admire all stories from post-apocalyptic world, originally created by Dmitry Glukhovsky. 

Don't really like the game series, somehow I just prefer the paper version of it. 

So far I've collected 14 books from this series (I think there's no more at the moment translated to Polish) and I can assure You that every one of them has a really interesting story to read (I still wonder, why no one has filmed any of them?)

##Sandbag

The name says it all. This is a special sport bag, that has multiple grips and is used to exercise. Filled with dry sand it weights around 20kg, which is pretty heavy, taking into account own weight during the calisthenic training. I can recommend this tool for everyone who prefer to workout home, and don't want to clutter up the house with sport equipment.

##Deus Ex: Human Revolution

The only game worth to mention here. A sci-fi/cyberpunk mix of shooter, RPG and stealth game, developed by Eidos Montreal. If You are a casual gamer and You're looking for great in-game story - You will love this game.

If You already finished this game and that was not enough don't worry - there's sequel planned next year to release ;)

And what's Your best investment in 2015?
