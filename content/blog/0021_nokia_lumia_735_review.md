#Nokia Lumia 735 Review

##As You can already know,I really don't like Windows as a desktop system much, but what Microsoft is doing with his Windows Phone version meets all my expectations from mobile system.

Combinatino of such great software and splendid (in design and performance field) hardware results in wonderful product. 

I've noticed two fractions about Lumia's design - some may accue Microsoft secondariness and continous reproduction of the same product design, and some like the similarities of this product line. 

Personally I really like the Lumia family product design - You can recognize any of them at first glance; minimalistic, solid, often enclosed in  one-piece, unibody form with bright colors.

Its worth mention, that Nokia Lumia was the first such colorful product line - nowadays most manufacturers copy that trend.

##Despite the large selection of colors I've chosen the white one - it looks even more clean & minimalistic than any other Lumias.

Unlike the classic Lumia products, this model has a replaceable cover and battery - You can also buy red/orange, bright green and black case. I think it's a good move from Nokia, which extends the fun of owning this model.

In the package with the phone, we can find pair of nice (as for a default one) headphones, and ugly-and-nothing-special-standard-looking black charger(Lumia 800 has still the best designed charger design in the market)
