#The perfect browser

##I wrote this post after getting inspired by [this article on Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/fuck-it-im-going-back-to-firefox-1685425815)

These days net users have tought life. We need at least i-series processor, couple gigabytes of ram and pretty fast DSL (or LTE) connection to just *BROWSE THE WEB*. Yes, I've name it - to just surf around the net regular user has to acquire hardware that exceeds couple times the one that has sent human to the moon.
