#Design (for web, product and branding)

At the beginning of my adventure with web development I was focused on the design part of web development process. 

Now, when I'm a full-stack coder it results with more flexibility and independence from designers.

In practice: if there's something missing in the page template, I can manage myself and design missing elements of the website (so we don't have to wait for contact with designer -> set the details -> receive missing elements).

Furthermore, I'm still helping clients with their design issues (including web design and branding), confronting their ideas with current design trends.

FYI: I'm a minimalist lover so You can imagine what to expect from my projects.
