#10th anniversary of jQuery

##Couple days ago (14/01/2016) jQuery had its 10th anniversary.

Today I would like to personally thank every contributor of this awesome tool. 

Until now, I thought that jQuery is way older that it really is. 

I remember it since the beginning of my interests about the Internet. 

To be honest, I really can't see myself without this tool. It's my greatest companion when creating web related stuff.

It can be a shame to admit, but sometimes I think that I'm a better "jQuery programmer" than pure javascript one :) My couple first projects was based exclusively on jQuery functions/methods and almost without any pure js code :)

I found it a lot easier to play with DOM elements using jQuery library - this state is especially caused by way shorter syntax (in most of my code use-cases). 

The other reason why I think jQuery is awesome are the plugins. There are TONS of them. If You need some advanced slider - just google it. Or maybe You have to deal with huge, dynamic tables? No problem ,there are plenty of handy plugins, battle-tested and documented very well. 

There's only one big question that bothers me - in how many of actual projects do You use jQuery version above 1.9? I've found that many libraries/plugins doesn't support such new version. And I've just read that there's an early preview of jQuery third version! :)

Personally, I use jQuery 1.9.1 in most of my project, because of wide supported plugins collection.

I'm very curious which version are You using, and how jQuery affected to Your programming career.

Happy birthday, jQuery!
