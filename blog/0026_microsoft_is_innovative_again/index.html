      <h1 id="microsoft-is-an-innovative-company-again">Microsoft is an innovative company again</h1>
      
      <h2 id="even-if-im-not-a-huge-microsoft-fan-i-have-to-admit-that-microsoft-has-become-the-leader-of-truly-innovative-products-again">Even if I’m not a huge Microsoft fan I have to admit, that Microsoft has become the leader of truly innovative products again.</h2>
      
      <p>Let’s take a look at latest products of the Microsoft:</p>
      
      <h1 id="surface-book">Surface Book</h1>
      
      <p>A perfect match of laptop + tablet device that doesn’t look like a crap. To be honest, the design of the product reminds me of Macbook Pro/Air - especially the Microsoft’s shiny logo on the lid.
      This product has all the must-have-in-my-next-device sparkle properties: i7 processor, 12GB of RAM, good GPU, 512GB SSD, long on-battery life, backlit keyboard and detachable screen/tablet feature. 
      I only wish that the price will get lower in the meantime, because now it’s pretty high, even for such great piece of hardware.</p>

      <p>For more information, go to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/devices/surface-book">Microsoft’s website</a>.</p>
      
      <h1 id="continuum">Continuum</h1>
      
      <p>As a addicted WindowsPhone(7 &amp; 8, now waiting for 10 mobile update) user I can’t wait for this feature. This can be funny a bit, because I use linux as my prior system, but I have also a Windows installation on remote HDD for some rare tasks.</p>
      
      <h1 id="smartphone-with-liquid-cooling-system-wait-what">Smartphone with liquid cooling system.. wait, what?</h1>
      
      <p>I think the title says it all. I haven’t heard anything crazy like that before.</p>
      
      <h1 id="augmented-reality-on-the-next-level">Augmented reality on the next level</h1>
      
      <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aThCr0PsyuA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      
      <p>I remember the first time I’ve seen the promo video of the HoloLens product - I was amazed like a little kid, who unpacked the Christmas gift and found a Famicom console in the begining of the 90’s.</p>
      
      <p>I see various great use-cases for this device and I can’t wait for this product become mainstream like PCs in our flats.</p>
      
      <p>As a programmer, I’m a bit afraid about difficulties associated with application development for this kind of platform - I hope Microsoft will deliver proper developer-friendly tools as a solution.</p>
      
      <h1 id="design">Design</h1>
      
      <p>To be honest I’m very happy that Microsoft takes inspiration from the best products on the market (SurfaceBook vs Macbook, Lumia 930 vs iPhone 4/5 etc.) and sets its own trends such Lumia’s colorful unibody design or classic Surface product line.</p>
      
      <p>And the last, but not the least: the software design. Microsoft was the first company that has introduced and implemented in the greatest way the flat design.</p>
      
      <p>Let’s face it - apple screwed up totally their flat-or-not-flat design - especially on mobile - it’s just ugly. It was the one of the reasons, why I’ve switched back to linux - OSX’s design also began to suck lately.</p>
      
      <p>I’ve seen also couple pretty nice custom themes for android, but only Microsoft gives us the beautiful OS out of the box (especially on mobile - I’m a big fan of tiles :) ).</p>
      
      <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
      
      <p>Some people hates Microsoft, other hates Apple - personally I think I’m in the middle of that world.</p>
      
      <p>I admire previous generation of apple products, but really don’t like current one. On the other hand I was pretty uncertain about Microsoft products (beyond WP and Lumia family ;) ) but now I’m really impressed with the direction which seeks company from Redmond.</p>
      
      <p>But hey, in the end I’m just a regular Windows Phone user, who uses Linux (Elementary OS) as a primary desktop system and develops mobile applications, mainly for Android - that’s pretty common platform combo, right? :)</p>
