#Nokia Lumia 735 Review

##As You can already know,I really don't like Windows as a desktop system much, but what Microsoft is doing with his Windows Phone version meets all my expectations from mobile system.

Combination of such great software and splendid (in design and performance field) hardware results in wonderful product. 

I've noticed two fractions about Lumia's design - some may accue Microsoft secondariness and continous reproduction of the same product design, and some like the similarities of this product line. 

Personally I really like the Lumia family product design - You can recognize any of them at first glance; minimalistic, solid, often enclosed in  one-piece, unibody form with bright colors.

Its worth mention, that Nokia Lumia was the first such colorful product line - nowadays most phone manufacturers copy that trend.

##Despite the large selection of colors I've chosen the white one - it looks even more clean & minimalistic than any other Lumias.

Unlike the classic Lumia products, this model has a replaceable cover and battery - You can also buy red/orange, bright green and black case. I think it's a good move from Nokia, which extends the fun of owning this model.

In the package with the phone, we can find pair of nice (as for a default one) headphones, and ugly-and-nothing-special-standard-looking black charger(Lumia 800 has still the best designed charger design in the market)

##Make some noise!

During phone calls I haven't noticed any particular problems with call quality - neither my callers. To be honest, quality of the speaker or the microphone is pretty standard - it is good, but I think it could be better.

I cannot say the same about the backside speaker (which plays music or ringtones) - it is the loudest speaker I've ever met in the smartphone. Although It's the shame that its quality is not so good when set to max volume - I've noticed some noises during loud, high frequency sounds (low basses sounds pretty good).

##\#Selfie

Nokia Lumia 735 has two cameras: 6.7Mpx rear (with flash) and 5Mpx front one - both are very good, even in low light. In addition, WindowsPhone has great software for photography: standard *Lumia Camera* app with ring controls (I love this idea) or *Lumia Refocus* which allows You to change photo's depth of field **AFTER** doing and saving it on the memory card.
