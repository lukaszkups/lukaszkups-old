#Silver month

If You are following me at [twitter](http://twitter.com/ofcapl) You probably know that I've implemented color randomizer for my site.

This week I decided to choose best brand color (in my opinion) and check how it will affect to web traffic. By the end of the month I will code:

<pre>
	<code class="ruby">
		def costam do
			return 0
		end
	</code>
</pre>
