#Using nanoc with github pages

##This guide is based on the originally posted article at [Schmurfy's blog](http://schmurfy.github.io/2011/05/06/create_your_github_user_page_with_nanoc.html) - I've modified it for current github pages flow.

Let's get it started.

First, clone Your nanoc page repository to local disk and enter it:

~~~bash

git clone yourRepoCloneUrl
cd yourRepoFolder
~~~

Now, if You don't have `output` folder yet create it, then clone Your repo again into that directory:

~~~bash

mkdir output
git clone yourRepoCloneUrl output
~~~

Let's enter this folder and create isolated (orphan) branch, `gh-pages`:

~~~bash

cd output
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
~~~

Next we have to clean all the contents from our `output` folder's git track:

~~~bash

git rm -rf .
~~~

Now re-check if You are on `gh-pages` branch - there's possibility that You're now on detached state - if so then type:

~~~bash

git checkout gh-pages
~~~ 

To avoid problems in the future, remove the `master` branch from the `output` folder:

~~~bash

git branch -d master
~~~

Everything should be set here, so now enter the main project folder and try to compile it:

~~~bash

cd ..
nanoc aco
~~~

And that's it! Everything that is outside the `output` folder belongs to Your master branch (so You should push every change You want to keep.

If You want to publicize Your nanoc page, compile the project, enter the `output` folder (you should be switched automatically to `gh-pages` branch) then commit and push Your changes to Your `gh-pages` repo branch.

And that's it! If You ever need any help with nanoc and gh-pages - let me know on [twitter](http://twitter.com/lukaszkups).
