      <p>Finally I’ve got motivated enough to setup my website (again). For the long time I was complaining that I need to do it and start writing again.</p>
      
      <p>Fortunately, New Year 2015 has arrived and helped me to move my that-thing-where-shoulders-loose-its-noble-name and at last I’ve built my website (again).</p>
      
      <p>So, what’s the goals and resolutions for the new year?</p>
      
      <p>First of all - start writing (regularly). I’ve collected pretty nice amount of stuff that I would like to save somewhere. I’m this kind of person who like to have everything in one place - especially code related stuff. Recently I’ve switched from OSX to linux and most of my solutions of programming problems disappeared. To prevent a repetition of this kind of situation I want to save some of my code stuff here.</p>
      
      <p>Secondly - spend more time with a family and less time online. Last year, especially in the middle of it, I was in the anti-procrastination-loop very often - You know, that time when You’re spending most of Your free time watching stupid videos of cats or reading tons of news. During the Christmas  holiday I was mostly AFK - and I realised how much I’ve needed it. My self-motivation reached over 9000 level (one of results of this state is this website).</p>
      
      <p>And finally - move, move, move &amp; move (more) - because lately my physical condition is … hmn … nope, it just isn’t.</p>
      
      <p>So, all the best in ‘15,</p>
      
      <p>– ł.</p>
