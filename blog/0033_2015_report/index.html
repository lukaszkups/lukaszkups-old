      <h2 id="after-12-months-of-blogging-ive-decided-to-share-some-stats-about-it">After 12 months of blogging I’ve decided to share some stats about it.</h2>
      
      <p>During this year I’ve published 33 <a href="http://lukaszkups.net/notes/">blog posts</a> which had read 12002 times by 6396 unique users.</p>
      
      <p>80.6% of this were newcomers, 19.4 were a returning visitors.</p>
      
      <p>Most users were English (USA) speakers, Polish (Poland) second and French (France) at the third place. There was also some interest from India, China and Germany.</p>
      
      <p>The most popular browser used by my readers is Chrome (~77%), Firefox (~13%) and Safari (~4%).</p>
      
      <p>Most popular operating system among my visitors is OSX (~55%) then Windows (~24%) and linux (~13%). At mobile field most popular is iOS (~50%), then Android (~36%) and Windows Phone (~10%).</p>
      
      <h2 id="twitter-stats">Twitter stats</h2>
      
      <p>I’ve tweeted about my blog posts 92 times (1438 in total) and those tweets get 1-10 likes/favs and 2-5 retweets. My average engagement rate is at ~2% and my tweets gets ~50k impressions (views) each month.</p>
      
      <p>Leading interests among my readers are: technology, tech news, computer programming, open source, mobile, business and news, entrepreneurship and startups.</p>
      
      <p>At the moment of writing this article I’ve got a 177 twitter followers, that’s around +50 since January 2015. I’ve got 200+ followers at peak this year, but lost them due to twitter nickname change (from @ofcapl to @lukaszkups).</p>
      
      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      
      <p>I’ve found those stats pretty interesting. Thanks to the idea of writing this blog post I’ve learned a bit about google analytics (I’ve never used it for serious resarch earlier) and twitter analytics (I didn’t even know that there’s such tool ;)).</p>
      
      <h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
      
      <p>I want to start a new blog serie: <strong>tldr</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>I’ll try to publish every week a blog post with summary of interesting articles that I’ve read - I want to do this because I’ve found that I’m addicted to reading information (I think it’s some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FoMO</a> disease) but (at the same time) very often I forget what I’ve read a day or two ago.</p>
      
      <p>Currently I’m also making a personal project (made with &lt;3 and meteorjs, aside from my full-time job) which takes most of my energy. This is the second reason of keeping many articles in draft state at the moment (don’t have time to polish them) - the first reason is my awesome family (and a 1+ year old cool guy can be demanding sometimes :))</p>
      
      <p>At the beginning of 2016 I plan also a redesign of my personal space - I hope to succeed because I’ve tried many redesigns but in the end I’ve always came back to current one :)</p>
      
      <p>And You? What’s Your plan for 2016?</p>
      
      <p>– ł.</p>
