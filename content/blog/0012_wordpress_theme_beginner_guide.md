#Creating Wordpress theme beginner guide

##Disclaimer - I'm not a php programmer, I don't like php actually, but I'm getting pretty convinced that not everything made with php can be bad.

Couple days ago I had to prepare & code a Wordpress template for a client. I was mostly avoiding such tasks, because of its php-relation (I don't really like php for its syntax or its outdated standards & assumptions). So I've finished this task thanks to Wordpress (codex) documentation & some basic stackoveflow questions about php language.

So, here's some basic tips, which helped me a lot during development:

#View templates



#Custom page templates

If we want to create some really custom view, we need to add to our theme folder a file named with convention: `page_nameOfThePage.php` and then add *nameOfThePage* as a page object in its Wordpress admin section - Wordpress engine will link them with each other.
