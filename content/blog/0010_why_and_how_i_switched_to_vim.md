#Good & bad cop.

For the last couple years I was developing web apps using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) exclusively. During that time I was also constantly monitoring code editors market and tried some of its newcomers (e.g. github's [atom](http://atom.io) or adobe's [brackets](http://brackets.io)), but in the long run I was always coming back to Sublime.

#Cool kids from the block

Besides old habits and laziness about learning new tool that should help me write code I was always curious about those oldschool, antique at the first look console editors like [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) or [vim](http://vim.org). There is something magical about these apps - all those badass hackers and world-class conference speakers are using it. Why?

#Back to the roots

Emacs and Vim exist on the code editors scene for some time now. That means they are hardened in the (development) battle. You can find plugins for almost any task for code editor. Their simplicity means that they can launch in milliseconds. You can also pimp Your editor like a true gangsta and gain some respect in the neighbourhood. Advanced keymapping options make Your fingers dance on the keyboard like John Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorner without getting saturday night fever.
