#Phonegap / Cordova mobile app development

Phonegap is a open-source framework that allows to create mobile apps (multi-platform) using standarized APIs - and all that magic can be done with javascript. 

I've build couple mobile apps using Phonegap, e.g. house design configurator app or tourist app which is truncated version of its web (rich) equivalent. 

For more awesomeness, Meteorjs since version 0.9+ enables conversion its web apps to phonegap mobile ones (<3).
