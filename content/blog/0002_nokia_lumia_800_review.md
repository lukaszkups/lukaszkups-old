#Nokia Lumia 800 review

![lumia](/blog/images/lumia_03.jpg)

I don't really like many Microsoft products (yeah, that's a nice kind of intro), but their Windows Phone 7+ system is one their greatest achievements - in design and software field.

Most of my early smartphones was based on Android OS. I've never been fully satisfied about any of them. 

Don't get me wrong: Android OS is a really nice product but there's one particular reason that drives me crazy about it: stability and reliability. Many times when I needed to do something on a smartphone really quick Android failed me(slowed down or totally freezed). 
This kind of failures is unacceptable for a device priced ~1000PLN.

Fortunately, in November 2011 Nokia announced and started to sell Lumia devices with Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 OS. Despite the reluctance to products from Microsoft company I was fascinated about *Metro* (later renamed but adopted by nobody to *Modern UI* ) and Nokia's Lumia phone design.

After first reviews about WP7, I started thinking about switch. Despite lack of customization options and very, very small amount of apps in its market I've finally bought my first WP7 phone - *Nokia Lumia 800*.

##It has been three years since I've bought Lumia 800. And it is so far the longest used phone by me. 

In the meantime I've bought *HTC 8X* with new, Windows Phone 8.1 OS. I've sold it after couple days of use because of very short battery life. I also had a pleasure using *Lumia 920* temporary as my second phone, and it was awesome experience.

##The Good

As I mentioned earlier - I'm really impressed about *Metro* design. In my opinion, Windows Phone 7+ is the clearest and most beautiful mobile system ever. Its simplicity and directness of data presentation layer makes WP7+ most useful and user-friendly operating system for smartphone.

The device itself forwards purity & elegance of Lumia's design line. The phone case is built from polycarbonate single-piece unibody (which means producer prevents from battery replacement) with minimum amount of physical buttons: Volume Up/Down, screen lock and camera trigger.

Besides physical buttons, Lumia 800 has 3 touch icons at the front panel: back, home and search. Besides their regular purpose, we can access all opened applications by holding down back button for ~1sec.

Ports placement is also a plus for Nokia's design team. They're practically invisble during everyday usage - placed on top side of the phone. To access MicroUSB port we need to reveal small cover.

Nokia's device doesn't support external cards.
