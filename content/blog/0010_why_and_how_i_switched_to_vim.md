#Why (and how) I've switched to vim

##Good & bad cop.

For the last couple years I was developing web apps using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) exclusively. During that time I was also constantly monitoring code editors market and tried some of its newcomers (e.g. github's [atom](http://atom.io) or adobe's [brackets](http://brackets.io)), but in the long run I was always coming back to Sublime.

##Cool kids from the block

Besides old habits and laziness about learning new tool that should help me write code I was always curious about those oldschool, antique at the first look console editors like [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) or [vim](http://vim.org). There is something magical about these apps - all those badass hackers and world-class conference speakers are using it. Why?

##Back to the roots

Emacs and vim exist on the code editors scene for some time now. That means they are hardened in the (development) battle. You can find plugins for almost any task for code editor. Their simplicity means that they can launch in milliseconds. You can also pimp Your editor like a true gangsta and gain some respect in the neighbourhood. Advanced keymapping options will make Your fingers dance on the keyboard like John Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorner without getting saturday night fever.

##Coders just wanna have fun

The best thing about my job is that I love what I do, and it gives me tons of fun. I think it is the most important thing in (profession-side of) life - otherwise we'll be constantly depressed and do our job not so good as we're able to. 

In the earliest days of my carreer I had pleasure to work with awesome programmers who used vim as their main tool for code. At that day I was mainly focused to learn programming itself, rather than text editor usage - I think it would be a huge waste of time (especially that I was a beginner programmer). 

In my current job some programmers switched from their advanced IDEs to emacs. Their first days of work with new tool were quite funny - they make code many times slower than before, and have problems handling basic text editor operations :) After some time I've noticed significant improvement in their workflow - they're now coding as fast as in the days when they used their IDEs.
Now they have tools that  are easier to re-setup on every new machine they have to work on, and it uses much less their computer resources. These pros convinced me to give a shot and try something new. 

##First days of summer

I don't want to start next Text Editors (flame) War, so I'll tell why I've chosen vim over emacs: just because I could :) I've seen how coders are working with emacs and vim and vim workflow just
