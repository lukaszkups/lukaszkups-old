#Javascript

Which technology is sexy today? 

The answer is: javascript.

After 3 years of struggling between C#, Ruby and Python (and avoiding PHP for all costs) I've found language-to-rule-them-all.

Now, after 2+ years of working mainly with JS I can say that is not a ideal language, but for sure it is worth learning (and trying to understand its core principles).

I'm using js where I can - if there's an option to use js or other technology - You can be sure that I'll choose js.
