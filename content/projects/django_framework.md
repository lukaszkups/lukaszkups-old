#Django framework

Django is a open-source framework, written in Python language. I've found it has many similarities to RoR, but it gives more freedom on application and code structure.

Using Django in backend I've helped creating (on front-end side with little backend code modifications) home websites for many companies, photograph portfolios, online shops (some with advanced products configuration e.g. exclusive furniture shop with furniture visual configurator), tourist web apps or simple contact-pages connected to CMS.
