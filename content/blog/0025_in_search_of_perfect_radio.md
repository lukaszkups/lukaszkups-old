#In search of perfect radio

During the last weekend I was searching after some nice radio for my flat. My needs are listed below:

-- minimal, stylish design,

-- USB port for remote music sources,

-- CD/DVD drive slot,

-- full mp3 support,

-- (nice-to-have) microSD slot,

-- at least moderate sound quality,

-- reasonable price.

And that's all. I thought that wasn't excessive requirements in XXI century but I was wrong.

Terribly wrong.

Most of devices I've found was in two variants: retro style, with wooden and chrome textures on plastic parts or completely swollen, 90's street style boomboxes.

Damn, there are so many fine electronic companies, which manufacture great quality products, but with lack of fine design.

##So I decided to design my own.

At first, I've gone though sketching some basic shape of the radio (I've decided to design a modular product - main radio + 2 loudspeakers):
