#Open Source user & contributor

Is there any chance that web that all we know today could be the same if there will be no open-sourced software?

Definitely not.

jQuery, bjqs, localscroll, bootstrap, ionic, locache, sortable, hammer, spin, scrollMagic, leaflet, plax, backstretch, pixi, rails, node, django, skrollr and billions of other projects formed the web. 

Thanks to open-source we can build cheaper, faster and more reliable products. We don't have to reinvent the wheel, we can use already developed and tested software.

I'm an active contributor to tools that I'm using - I'm reporting bugs and propose solutions if my knowledge is sufficient, and I call every developer to do the same - let's make an open-source world a better place together.
