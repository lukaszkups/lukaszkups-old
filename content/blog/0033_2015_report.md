#2015 report

##After 12 months of blogging I've decided to share some stats about it.

During this year I've published 33 [blog posts](http://lukaszkups.net/notes/) which had read 12002 times by 6396 unique users.

80.6% of this were newcomers, 19.4 were a returning visitors.

Most users were English (USA) speakers, Polish (Poland) second and French (France) at the third place. There was also some interest from India, China and Germany.

The most popular browser used by my readers is Chrome (~77%), Firefox (~13%) and Safari (~4%).

Most popular operating system among my visitors is OSX (~55%) then Windows (~24%) and linux (~13%). At mobile field most popular is iOS (~50%), then Android (~36%) and Windows Phone (~10%).

##Twitter stats

I've tweeted about my blog posts 92 times (1438 in total) and those tweets get 1-10 likes/favs and 2-5 retweets. My average engagement rate is at ~2% and my tweets gets ~50k impressions (views) each month.

Leading interests among my readers are: technology, tech news, computer programming, open source, mobile, business and news, entrepreneurship and startups.

At the moment of writing this article I've got a 177 twitter followers, that's around +50 since January 2015. I've got 200+ followers at peak this year, but lost them due to twitter nickname change (from @ofcapl to @lukaszkups). 

##Summary

I've found those stats pretty interesting. Thanks to the idea of writing this blog post I've learned a bit about google analytics (I've never used it for serious resarch earlier) and twitter analytics (I didn't even know that there's such tool ;)).

##Future plans

I want to start a new blog serie: **tldr**.

I'll try to publish every week a blog post with summary of interesting articles that I've read - I want to do this because I've found that I'm addicted to reading information (I think it's some kind of [FoMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) disease) but (at the same time) very often I forget what I've read a day or two ago. 

Currently I'm also making a personal project (made with <3 and meteorjs, aside from my full-time job) which takes most of my energy. This is the second reason of keeping many articles in draft state at the moment (don't have time to polish them) - the first reason is my awesome family (and a 1+ year old cool guy can be demanding sometimes :))

At the beginning of 2016 I plan also a redesign of my personal space - I hope to succeed because I've tried many redesigns but in the end I've always came back to current one :)

And You? What's Your plan for 2016?
