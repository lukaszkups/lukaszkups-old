      <h1 id="why-i-decided-to-switch-from-meteorjs-to-php">Why I decided to switch from Meteor.js to PHP</h1>
      
      <h2 id="during-the-last-couple-weeks-ive-been-learning-basics-of-php-language-i-think-im-the-first-person-ive-ever-heard-of-who-knows-ruby-python-or-nodejs-on-at-least-beginner-level-and-decided-to-switch-to-one-of-the-oldest-web-languages-out-there">During the last couple weeks I’ve been learning basics of PHP language. I think I’m the first person I’ve ever heard of who knows Ruby, Python or Node.js on at least beginner level and decided to switch to one of the oldest web languages out there.</h2>
      
      <h1 id="current-state-of-meteorjs">Current state of Meteor.js</h1>
      
      <h2 id="welcome-to-the-jungle">Welcome to the jungle</h2>
      
      <p>Currently, Meteor.js project state is a mess. If You’ve just started learning Meteor, You’ve chosen the worst time possible. Or maybe it’s better than starting year ago.</p>
      
      <p>The Meteor itself is still in an active development and I mean VERY ACTIVE development here. There is no such thing like “best practices” to do something, because after one week it changes to something completely different.</p>
      
      <p>I was learning Meteor.js in golden times for Blaze renderer and Iron Router router (;)). Meteor seemed so great and straightforward for me that time.</p>
      
      <p>Time flies and things change.</p>
      
      <p>Iron Router has been replaced with Flow Router, uploading files is still not yet standarized - the one solution I know is to use cfs packages but some folks out there suggests that it isn’t production-ready. I’ve also read more and more articles which says that Blaze v2 project is already doomed/not best option and the best solution would be to learn React.js and make it work as a frontend render engine.</p>
      
      <p>And/or maybe next week it won’t be longer valid best practice.</p>
      
      <h1 id="current-state-of-business-in-poland">Current state of business in Poland</h1>
      
      <h2 id="dollar-dollar-billy-all">Dollar, dollar bill’y all</h2>
      
      <p>As a freelancer, most of my clients are small to medium companies. Most of them has already their own, super-cheap, configured and paid 100 years forward (;)) cheap hosting.</p>
      
      <p>In that cases, my only solution is to use technology which is supported by their hosting provider/server plan - and that’s PHP in 99.9%. Most of them doesn’t even support Mongodb.</p>
      
      <h1 id="current-state-of-my-knowledge">Current state of my knowledge</h1>
      
      <h2 id="so-youre-a-webdev-and-you-dont-know-php">So, You’re a webdev and You don’t know PHP?</h2>
      
      <p>I’m the only webdev I know, who doesn’t know a thing about PHP. At the same time I’m the only webdev I know who can code in Ruby, Rails, Python, Django, Node.js, Meteor.js and decided to switch to PHP. (;))</p>
      
      <p>Furthermore, I somehow missed the hype for javascript frontend frameworks. Ember, Angular, Backbone etc. were pushed into the background while I was learning Rails, Django and Meteor but now I think that I should know at least one of them to fit into the market requirements.</p>
      
      <p>So I decided to update my knowledge a bit - I’ve already seen Angular and Ember in action, but it doesn’t suit for me. Currently I’m learning Backbone.js + PHP and I think they can be a nice pair of technologies for my daily use.</p>
      
      <p>Referring again to Meteor I have to mention, that I was in love with its capacity to make a mobile apps. Now things changed a bit - I’ve found another tool for this task: <strong>Intel XDK</strong> which makes mobile app development even easier (I’ll write about that in my future article).</p>
      
      <h1 id="current-state-of-the-future">Current state of the future</h1>
      
      <h2 id="big-things-have-small-beginnings">Big things, have small beginnings</h2>
      
      <p>Learning something different doesn’t mean that I abandon Meteor.js. I plan to still monitor what’s going on the Meteor community and which road it will go.</p>
      
      <p>For me and my personal needs Meteor.js just evolves too fast.</p>
      
      <p>In my opinion it is currently the most interesting tool in market. I bet that it will revolutionize the way we develop applications (not only web-based).</p>
      
      <p>In the meantime, I’ll just sit here and watch how it raise to the rank of mature, more stable tool.</p>
      
      <p>..and code in PHP :)</p>
