#Meteor.js framework

Meteor is a open-source javascript framework, created on top of Node.js. It uses [Distributed Data Protocol](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2012/03/21/introducing-ddp)(DDP) for fetching data from server and receive live updates on the client side. 

I've decided to go full-stack with Meteor because I've fallen in love with its simplicity and fast way of building modern web apps. As a javascript coder I was waiting for tool that enables using js on the client and server side. 

I've chosen Meteor as a tool for my Master Thesis project: "Development of Content Management System build in Node.js environment" which, even if it is currently defended, is constantly upgrading in my spare time. 

Moreover I've created couple company websites using my own (Meteor-based) CMS or/and converted Meteor projects to mobile apps.
