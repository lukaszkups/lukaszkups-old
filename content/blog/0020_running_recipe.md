#Running recipe

5:30AM, the sun rises, in headphones flies "A Song the World Can Sign Out Loud" by A Change of Pace ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u34RVvOByw8)) and I run.

Best

experience

ever.

Now it's 6:30AM and I'm sitting in the front of my computer writing this (and finishing other one) blog post. I can't remember when the last time I could get into "the Zone" ([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)). I even suspected the burnout syndrome, but after today's running session I feel my brain refreshed. 

I think I'll schedule my workouts to early hours permanently - and I recommend the same for You.
