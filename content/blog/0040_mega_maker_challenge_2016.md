#Mega Maker 2016 challenge

##There is a lot of hype about creating stuff recently. Couple days ago I've came across the product which transforms this topic into something even more awesome.

Introducing: [Mega Maker Challenge](http://megamaker.co/) by [@mijustin](https://twitter.com/mijustin)

This Canadian guy has got into this awesome idea to connect all creators out there into one community. 

Every participant can share his/her goals for current year - Justin (the creator of Mega Maker) even prepared his own list with 100 unique elements!

I think such activity is very motivating, because when I share such list with the world I'll be more determinated to prove everyone that I've made it! :)

Also, I've recently get to the point in my life, where I had to specify my future. I struggled with questions like: am I a web developer? Or maybe a javascript programmer? But I've also made couple mobile apps recently! 

As You could already noticed in my [twitter's profile bio](http://twitter.com/lukaszkups) I've realised: I am a web maker!

Since high school I make stuff around the web (websites, design, branding, blogs, advertising etc.) so I think this is the most appropriate word to describe myself ;)

Enough talk, feel free to check out my list (still in beta, constantly adding new stuff) :

1. New, more frequent blog post serie
2. More blog posts than in previous year (34+)
3. Learn PHP
4. Master Wordpress
5. Create at least 5 Wordpress themes
6. Start selling WP themes on Theme Forest or individually
7. Make more icons and upload them to nounproject
8. Rebrand myself
9. Redesign my website
10. Create own manifesto
11. Learn Backbone.js
12. Create awesome API-based CMS with backbone.js-based frontend and use it at own website
13. Create HTML5 rpg game
14. Make at least 5 minimalistic T-shirt designs and start selling it
15. Create minimalistic wallpaper for all my devices (PC, smartphone)
16. Participate in at least one conference
17.Learn how to make at least one new dish
18. Create at least one minimal/funny website (something like before: http://shouldireallyworkforfree.com)
19. Buy a moleskine notepad and start using it (again)
20. Read a book (non Metro 2033  related ;) )
21. Start writing a book seriously (complete it at least in 75% in the end of the year)
22. Branding / redesign of an open-source project/website (bacause most of them are pretty ugly :/ )
23. Create a Youtube music video (something like Khameleon808 did :D)
24. Create a tech / non-tech presentation
25. Cleanup my phone contact list :)
26. Create a new (not digital) game with my kid
27. 3D print something
28. Create Open-Source project
29. Take a stunning photo
30. Create a interview with internet idols and publish it on the blog
31. Earn double salary (from side-projects and jobs) in at least one month
32. Learn my kid something new each month
33. Meet all my long-not-seen friends
34. Create a new drink (non-alcoholic)
35. Find new awesome music tracks that takes me into 'the zone' while working

As You can see, some of the points are just goals, but each of them requires prior creation process to finish.

You can also see always-updated version of my list [here (google docs)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qUit1nI5k-Bus81YVU9Q-YbenJ_jn5Kmh2XmFpVs0Ng/edit?usp=sharing) - I will also check the status of each of them there.

And how about You? Are You ready to join Mega Maker challenge?
