#New Year's resolutions - '16 edition

Damn, time goes on so fast - I remember when I was writing my first blog post almost a year ago like it was yesterday.

I'm really happy that I've managed to write couple things during the past year - it only proves me that I was successful with my last year resolutions.

Here's my thoughts about next year resolutions:

##Try to write more often

Or maybe shorter articles - I have couple topics saved as drafts because I was trying to write about couple things at the same time but now I think it's not a good solution.
Like I've mentioned in my [previous blog post](http://lukaszkups.net/blog/0033_2015_report) I'll try to add new article type - a *tldr* one which will be something like interesting links aggregator with short descriptions - I hope it will help me remembering more contents that I'll read.

##Spend less time reading 

Hackernews, tech blogs, tumblr etc. I think I read too much a bit every single day - in the end I don't remember even half of the informations I've read.

##Spend more time with family

I think I'm on the right track with this - I was spending way much more time (with my family) during this year compared to previous one (which makes me really happy about it) and I will still improve that.

##Keep learning new stuff 

..and give a chance to stuff that was earlier underrated by me. A great example is PHP language - finally I've learned some basics at [codecademy](http://codecademy.com) and I've found it pretty interesting - my next objective it to learn backbonejs, gulp/grunt and master sass or less syntax. If I'll have some free time left I'll try do something with GameMaker tool.

##Move it, move it, move it!

Like year ago, I'll try to move & train (physically) even more - during past couple months I've managed (with my lovely wife) change our eating habits a bit and train alternately every other day which resulted in loosing 3 kilograms for me (I'm so proud because for the long time I couldn't lose weight).

##Redesign

I plan to redesign my site & rebrand (logo idea anyone?) - I have dozens of sketches with new layout but I'm constantly going back to current one - I think a new website will have pretty similar patterns to this one (it just suits me best).

##Repair keyboard

Last year I've accidentally flooded my laptop keyboard (Asus Zenbook UX32LN). Fortunately Asus has done great job and made this keyboard waterproof. Unfortunately, during the clean I've damaged the enter key on my keyboard - now it "jumps out" the keyboard on almost every click.

To my misfortune I've found that new keyboard costs almost 600 PLN (~150 USD) which is a really high price for a keyboard (most regular keyboards costs in Poland below 50 USD). 

PS. Dear Asus, if You're reading this, please be aware that You can give me an awesome Christmas present in the form of new Zenbook's keyboard :)

##Finish all side projects

I have two big/main side projects that are currently in a pretty active development. I've managed to build them from scratch during past year but now I've decided do change the main tool/technology behind it. I hope to finish them before the second half of 2016. 

Happy coding in the New Year everyone!
